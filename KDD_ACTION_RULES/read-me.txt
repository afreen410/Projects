Project Topic : Implementation Of Action Rules using Java

Action Rules refer to the rules that are extracted from information systems which describe possible transition of objects from one state to another with respect to a distinguished attribute called decision attribute. 

Learning from examples based on rough sets(LERS) are used to generate the certain and possible rules.The attribute on the right hand side of the rules generated by LERS 

Instructions:

The program is implemented in Java programming language.
GUI is provided using Java Swing.

Input: 

1.Select the data file, attribute file using the select data file and select attribute file buttons.

2. Load the data file and attribute file using the load data button.

3.After the data is loaded, the user can select the decision attribute from the list of attributes from the attribute file provided as input.

4.Provide the initial and final values for the decision attributes.

5.Select stable attributes from the list of stable attributes.

6.Provide values for minimum support and confidence for the action rules to be generated.

7.Click Generate Action Rules.

Output: 
The output includes the LERS steps for calculating the certain and possible rules. Then from the certain rules, action rules are generated by inspecting the flexible attributes on left hand side and decision attribute on the right hand side.
